# What is JAMstack?

> _Modern web development architecture with client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs and pre-built communication._ [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

JAMstack is a new way to make websites and applications that deliver better performance, greater safety, less cost of scale and better development experience.

## What do I get out of it?

Com o JAMstack é exibido o HTML gerado, sem a necessidade de renderizar informações de um servidor. Com isso o tempo de carregamento é mais rápido e diminui os riscos com segurança, ou seja, você consegue ter um site mais rápido, com melhor experiência do usuário, classficação no Google e mais tráfego.

With JAMstack, generated HTML is displayed, without the need to render information from a server. As a result, charging time is faster and risk-free, so you can have a faster site with better user experience, Google ranking and more traffic.

For those who are developer is even better, as it is much simpler, the html is generated through writing in markdown.

## Downsides

What about non-technical users? What content producers are with WordPress style editors who are not familiar with markdown and GitHub?

This is really a problem and some solutions are starting to emerge. Tools like [Prose.io](https://prose.io), integrate GitHub to provide a more user friendly UI for non-technical authors.

## Some technologies that can be used to create JAMstack applications

- Gatsby
- Next.js
- Nuxt
- Hugo
- Vuepress e much more

## What can be used by JAMstack?

Many applications can be made with JAMstack, and the possibilities are endless, ranging from simple blogs to ecommerce websites to more complex Web Apps.

My blog was completely made using JAMstack. All HTML is generated at the time of implementation and nothing else is happening.
