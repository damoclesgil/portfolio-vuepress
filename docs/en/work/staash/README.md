description: "Staash was created because of my experience in a design team a team of designers need to store web design inspiration in a simple, visually understandable way. Previous solutions included pinterest and savee but I felt this wasn't the most efficient way to store their valuable inspiration to use later. In Staash users simply input the title and url of the site they want to add to their teams repo and Staash will go out, grab and screenshot and add it to their teams list of sites."
