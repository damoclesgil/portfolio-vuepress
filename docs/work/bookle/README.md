description: "Bookle is an easy to use Ebook manager inspired by the Calibre open source project. I felt that the UI wasn't the greatest, could be simplified and users could have an overall better experience. This project served as an exploration into electron, handling their api and understanding the structure of ebooks, processing their metadata and making it editable."
